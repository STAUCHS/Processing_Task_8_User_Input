# Processing Task 8 - User Input

## Learning Objectives
In this task, you will learn about:
* Mouse Input
  - [ ] The `mouseX` and `mouseY` Variables
  - [ ] The `mousePressed` Variable
  - [ ] Mouse Input Event Functions (At least one of `mousePressed()`, `mouseReleased()`, `mouseClicked()`, `mouseMoved()`, `mouseDragged()`, `mouseWheel()`)
  - [ ] Combining Mouse Input variables and Event Functions
* Keyboard Input
  - [ ] The `keyPressed` Variable
  - [ ] The `key` Variable
  - [ ] The `keyCode` Variable
  - [ ] Keyboard Input Functions (At least one of `keyPressed()`, `keyReleased()`, `keyTyped`)
  - [ ] [Handling Multiple Keys](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/input#handling-multiple-keys)


## Step 1 - Lesson
Acquire the learning objectives by reviewing [this page from Happycoding.io](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/input)

## Step 2 - Task
Create a drawing program for a specific scene and demonstrate various input capabilities.  For example, you could create a garden drawing program where clicking creates flowers (randomly sized and colored?), dragging creates grass, the mouse wheel adds butterflies, keyboard changes the background or sky.  You can re-use methods from previous tasks defined to draw items to the screen (i.e flowers, clouds, etc).  You can also incorporate the images that can be moved and manipulated using input.  The objective is to demonstrate your ability to do as many of the lesson learning objectives as possible.
